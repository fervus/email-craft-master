We are going to build a platform that sends emails to a list of recipients using a self-hosted microsoft domain.
1. The emails should leave from the same email address.
2. The emails will be configured according to an xls file that has these columns:
    a. recipient email address
    b. email title
    c. email attachment file: path to an email attachment (pdf file) that needs to be attached to each sent email
    d. email text body with html / txt support and placeholders marked as |*var1*|, |*var2*|, etc..
    e. columns for var1, var2, etc...
3. The user will load the above xml file with drag and drop

4. The email attachments need to be loaded by the user with drag and drop in the interface somewhere and stored securely by the platform
    a. the user will be able to see a list of uploaded files with preview and List management tools like: multi-select, delete selected, delete single item in the list
    b. When sending it as an email attachment, the outbound email should contain the actual uploaded file, not the link to it as the link will be protected by account
    c. If a file with the same name is loaded, the old file will be overwritten.
    d. Storage is always temporary, it should auto-clear after campaign is sent with SUCCESS

5. When sending the actual emails, show a list of the sent emails and add a status for when those emails were sent. Remeber this activity in a MongoDb instance
6. Add a pixel tracker for when email was displayed and log the tracking in a database
7. Add secure login to the platform and user management.
